#InstrumentLearningProject1
This is a project used to learn and implement the knowledge of tools used to work on and set up a website.
The goal of the project is to build and deploy an updatable resume site, while using tools i may need in future.
Most of features are done exclusively in learning purposes, as I plan on using this knowledge in bigger projects.

Task:
1. Build a simple HTML/CSS site with my resume.
2. Put it on webserver and make sure it works correctly
3. Make sure to explain every step i make
4. Show off

Ready up to this point:
1. Code a website using HTML/CSS, while any of style-related code is in main html file.


Plans for the task:
Set up Linux to make sure i am able to work with it
Start building the pipeline using Jenkins
Learn how infrastracture as a code works, find a server to host website on. For this I will be using Terraform and possibly AWS servers
Learn javascript basics and add something unnecesary for fun

Automatically hosted website can be found here: https://benevolent-pasca-fb530a.netlify.app/
